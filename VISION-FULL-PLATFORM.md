## The Big Idea

Business education that bridges 2,300 years of Eastern strategic thinking with modern Western frameworks - for learners at every stage.

## What Makes This Distinctive

- **Not just another MBA** - rooted in Bharatiya strategic tradition (Chanakya, Thirukkural)
- **Not just ancient wisdom** - rigorous modern frameworks, case studies, practical tools
- **UK-India corridor focus** - uniquely positioned for the FTA opportunity
- **AI-powered content creation** - harness Claude to develop, refine, and scale content
